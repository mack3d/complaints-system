<b>My first application with PHP and MySQL when I learning these languages.</b>

The application allows you to register complaints for your company in a very simple way.

The free TCPDF class is used to print pdf documents.

It needs the company data.php file with your organization details in order to generate PDF documents correctly

$company_name = "YOUR COMPANY NAME";</br>
$company_street = "STREET";</br>
$company_phone = "PHONE";</br>
$company_city = "CITY";</br>
$company_zip_code = "ZIP CODE";</br>
$company_email = "name@company.com"</br>
